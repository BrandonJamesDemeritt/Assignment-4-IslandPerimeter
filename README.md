# Assignment 4 IslandPerimeter
 Assignment 4 for C++

Was tasked to read in a map of a single island from a file (represented by a two dimensional vector of 1's and 0's.  1 is land, 0 is water) and calculate and output the permimeter of the island.

The following parameters were given:

•Grid cells are connected horizontally and vertically (not diagonally).
•The grid is completely surrounded by water.
•There is exactly 1 island (1 set of connected land cells).
•The island does not have "lakes" (water inside that is not connected to the water around the island).
•Each cell is a square with side length 1.
•The grid is rectangular.
